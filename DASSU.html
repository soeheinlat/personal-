    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aung San Suu Kyi (/aʊŋ ˌsɑːn suː ˈtʃiː/;[3] Burmese: အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်; MLCTS: aung hcan: cu. krany Burmese<br> 
        pronunciation: [àʊɰ̃ sʰáɰ̃ sṵ tɕì]; born 19 June 1945) is a Burmese politician, diplomat, author, and a 1991 Nobel Peace<br> 
        Prize laureate who served as State Counsellor of Myanmar (equivalent to a prime minister) and Minister of Foreign Affairs<br> 
        from 2016 to 2021. She has served as the chairperson of the National League for Democracy (NLD) since 2011, having been<br> 
        the general secretary from 1988 to 2011.[4][5] She played a vital role in Myanmar's transition from military junta<br> 
        to partial democracy in the 2010s. The youngest daughter of Aung San, Father of the Nation of modern-day Myanmar,<br> 
        and Khin Kyi, Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon, British Burma. After graduating from the University of Delhi<br> 
        in 1964 and St Hugh's College, Oxford in 1968, she worked at the United Nations for three years. She married Michael<br> 
        Aris in 1972, with whom she had two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the 8888 Uprising of 8 August<br> 
        1988 and became the General Secretary of the NLD, which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army<br> 
        officials who criticized the military junta. In the 1990 elections, NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but<br> 
        the results were nullified, as the military government (the State Peace and Development Council – SPDC) refused to<br>
         hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had been detained before the elections and remained<br> 
         under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent<br> 
         political prisoners.[6] In 1999, Time magazine named her one of the "Children of Gandhi" and his spiritual heir to<br>
          nonviolence.[7] She survived an assassination attempt in the 2003 Depayin massacre when at least 70 people<br> 
          associated with the NLD were killed.[8] Her party boycotted the 2010 elections, resulting in a decisive victory<br> 
          for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). Aung San Suu Kyi became a Pyithu Hluttaw<br> 
          MP while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the 2012 by-elections. In the 2015 elections, her party won<br> 
          a landslide victory, taking 86% of the seats in the Assembly of the Union—well more than the 67% supermajority<br> 
          needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected president and second vice president in the presidential<br> 
          electoral college. Although she was prohibited from becoming the president due to a clause in the constitution—her<br> 
          late husband and children are foreign citizens—she assumed the newly created role of State Counsellor of Myanmar,<br> 
          a role akin to a prime minister or a head of government. When she ascended to the office of state counsellor,<br> 
          Aung San Suu Kyi drew criticism from several countries, organisations and figures over Myanmar's inaction in<br> 
          response to the genocide of the Rohingya people in Rakhine State and refusal to acknowledge that Myanmar's military<br> 
          has committed massacres.[9][10][11][12][13] Under her leadership, Myanmar also drew criticism for prosecutions<br> 
          of journalists.[14] In 2019, Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in the International Court of Justice where she defended<br> 
          the Burmese military against allegations of genocide against the Rohingya.[15] Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party<br> 
          had won the November 2020 Myanmar general election, was arrested on 1 February 2021 following a coup d'état that<br> 
          returned the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) to power and sparked protests across the country. Several charges<br> 
          were filed against her, and on 6 December 2021, she was sentenced to four years in prison on two of them. Later,<br> 
          on 10 January 2022, she was sentenced to an additional four years on another set of charges,[16] and on 27 April<br> 
          2022 she was sentenced to five years in prison on corruption charges.[17][18] The United Nations, most European<br> 
          countries, and the United States condemned the arrests, trials, and sentences as politically motivated.[19]</p>
